# Lux-Tech-Academy-Week-1-python-project
#### Project: Create a python function that when you inputs a number the function you have created checks whether the number belongs to the Fibonacci sequence or not.

Run the program and enter any positive integer.
The console will display "Fibonacci" if the entered number belongs to the fibonacci sequence, else it will print "NOT Fibonacci"
